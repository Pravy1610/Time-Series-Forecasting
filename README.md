# Time-series-forecasting 
Time series is a series as a series of data points which are recorded at different intervals of time where the time order can be daily, monthly or yearly. Time series analysis is a statistical model widely used in various disciplines to depict events during a particular period. This can reveal unexpected trends that can be used to depict future events. Data must be stationary i.e. properties such as average value, variation of the data, and standard deviation must not change over time. Data which is not stationary can result in wrong forecast results. Auto-correlation is another important parameter which assumes that the data needs to be auto-correlated. Data is said to be auto-correlated when it shows similar observations over a time lag present in the data.
